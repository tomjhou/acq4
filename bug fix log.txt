1. If you click "Start" in the patch module when no DAQ is present, it will produce an infinite number of consecutive errors until you press stop.

2. When loading protocols, sometimes it fails to set IC or VC because of a case (lower vs upper) error.

3. Stimulus amplitude is always zero in MockClamp and AxoPatch200. This is due to the following lines:
    a. MockClamp.py, line 361: self.cmdWidget.setMeta('y', minStep=scale, step=scale * 10, value=0.)
    b. AxoPatch200.py, line 564: self.cmdWidget.setMeta('y', minStep=scale, step=scale * 10, value=0.)
   The "value=0." part causes meta data to override stimulus amplitude (which also uses 'value' key).
   I can see no obvious reason for this, and have removed that part, which seems to fix it.
   But since it occurs twice, I can't help but think I am missing some reason for it to be there.
